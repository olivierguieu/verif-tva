=========

VerifTVA is provided thanks to the online service provided by [EC DG TAXUD](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/index_en.htm). First VAT numbers are verified against a regular expression and can then be verified through a call to the VIES web service.

The following tools, services were instrumental building VerifTVA:

 * [SUDZC for building the objective C SOAP client code](http://sudzc.com)
 * [Apple "Reachability" sample code](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/Reachability/Introduction/Intro.html)
 * [CountryPicker for iOS](https://www.cocoacontrols.com/controls/countrypicker?utm_source=Cocoa+Controls&utm_campaign=3034475857-Cocoa_Controls_Update3_26_2012&utm_medium=email)
